# Automated Validation of Methane Sniffer Protocols in Dairy Cattle using Object Dectection

## 📌 Project Overview
**Can we trust the data from methane sensors if we don't know where the cow's head is?**

This project validates the accuracy of  methane sniffer protocols using Computer Vision. By automating the tracking of cow head positions in milking parlors, we correlated behavioral data with sensor logs to biologically validate the standard sampling window.

Using **YOLOv8** and **RT-DETR**, the system tracks cattle under severe occlusion (infrastructure/feed bins) and uses unsupervised K-Means clustering to algorithmically determine feeding thresholds.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Amodal Detection:** Robust tracking of cattle heads under severe occlusion using custom-trained YOLOv8/RT-DETR models.
* **Algorithmic Thresholding:** Replaced manual guessing with **K-Means Clustering ($k=2$)** to scientifically define "Feeding" vs "Non-Feeding" states.
* **Interactive Tooling:** Built a custom NMS Tuning Tool (`tune_nms.py`) to optimize Confidence/IoU thresholds.
* **Biological Validation:** Confirmed the "Biphasic Feeding Pattern" aligns with the industry-standard 90s–410s sampling window.

* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Results at a Glance
The project successfully processed over **15,000 frames** of milking footage. The analysis revealed a clear "W-shaped" feeding pattern, proving that the standard 320-second sampling window is statistically sufficient to capture representative eructation (burp) events.

## 📈 Performance & Results

### 1. Model Evaluation (YOLOv8 vs RT-DETR)
The model achieved high precision even in low-light conditions. As seen in the Confusion Matrix, the model successfully distinguishes between the "Head" and background noise.
